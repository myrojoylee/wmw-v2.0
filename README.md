A full stack weather app written in React, TS, and Express. Stay tuned! What's different in this version versus the one I did before? We will be adding backend functionality to protect our API key as well as refactor the entire app to be in TypeScript! We will make use of custom hooks in order to further keep our code clean in separate components.
